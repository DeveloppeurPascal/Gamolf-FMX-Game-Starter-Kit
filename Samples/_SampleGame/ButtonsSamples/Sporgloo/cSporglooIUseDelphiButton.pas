  The "Gamolf FMX Game Starter Kit" is both a "technical" example of a video
  game developed in Delphi with everything you need inside and a reusable
  project template you can customize for your own games.

  The files provided are fully functional. Numerous comments are included in
  the sources to explain how they work and what you need to copy, override
  or customize to make video games without starting from scratch.
